This is my first exploration in to game programming on the Android platform. This is a simple "Missile Command" style game inspired from the classic Atari 80s arcade game (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile_Command).

This is a work in progress and it's not exactly cutting edge graphics: it is more a learning experience for me!
